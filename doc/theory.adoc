=== Subset is Left Distributive Over Union of Disjoint Intervals

For intervals A, B, and C, where B and C are disjoint, the following holds
true:

stem:[A subseteq (B uu C) -= (A subseteq B) vee (A subseteq C)]

=== Subsets of Unions of Disjoint Intervals

For disjoint intervals A and B, and disjoint intervals C and D, the following
holds true:

stem:[(A uu B) subseteq (C uu D) -= {(A subseteq C) vee (A subseteq D)} wedge {(B subseteq C) vee (B subseteq D)}]
