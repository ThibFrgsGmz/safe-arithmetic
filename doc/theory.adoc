== Introduction

=== Subset is Left Distributive Over Union

For non-overlapping intervals A, B, and C, the following holds true:

stem:[A subseteq (B uu C) -= (A subseteq B) vee (A subseteq C)]

=== Subset is Right Anti-Distributive over Union

stem:[(A uu B) subseteq C -= (A subseteq C) wedge (B subseteq C)]

=== Subsets of Unions

For non-overlapping intervals A, B, C, and D the following holds true:

stem:[(A uu B) subseteq (C uu D) -= {(A subseteq C) vee (A subseteq D)} wedge {(B subseteq C) vee (B subseteq D)}]

[cols="1,4,4"]
|===
| 1
| Given stem:[(A uu B) subseteq (C uu D)]

| 2
| stem:[{A subseteq (C uu D)} wedge {B subseteq (C uu D)}]
| Subset is Right Anti-Distributive over Union

| 3
| stem:[{(A subseteq C) vee (A subseteq D)} wedge {(B subseteq C) vee (B subseteq D)}]
| Subset is Left Distributive Over Union

| 4
| stem:[therefore (A uu B) subseteq (C uu D) -= {(A subseteq C) vee (A subseteq D)} wedge {(B subseteq C) vee (B subseteq D)}]

=== Cartesian Product of Unions

stem:[(A uu B) xx (C uu D) -= (A xx C) uu (B xx D) uu (A xx D) uu (B xx C)]

=== Cartesian Product is Distributive Over Union

stem:[A xx (B uu C) -= (A xx B) uu (A xx C)]

stem:[(B uu C) xx A -= (B xx A) uu (C xx A)]
